README
This submission follows all the given reduction rules and the grammar specifications of the provided example grammar for microC. However, the given reduction rules did not cover floating-point numbers and certain other elements. In this implementation, I have tried to incorporate those additional aspects such as floats to align with the microC specifications, while adhering to the structure of the provided grammar.

Please note, despite my efforts to follow the microC rules precisely, there might still be some inconsistencies or issues as I incorporated elements that were not fully defined in the provided reduction rules. This disclaimer is to highlight that any such issues arise from extending the grammar to handle aspects not explicitly mentioned in the assignment instructions.

All the required specifications have been followed, including symbol table printing, grammar reduction display, and creating the Makefile, test file, and parser rules as required.
