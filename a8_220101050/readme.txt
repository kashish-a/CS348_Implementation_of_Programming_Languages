This is a calculator designed to evaluate expressions and conversions from binary to decimal,binary to hexadecimal, hexadecimal to binary, hexadecimal to decimal.

Disclaimer:
1)This code will handle only integer evaluations, if any smaller expression evaluates to a decimal value, it will be handled as a integer value, i.e it will be rounded down.
2)This calculator assumes, that we have given the correct inputs, if we give erroneous inputs, we might get syntax error, or erroneous output.
3)Final expressions evaluated to negative integers will be handled, but negative integers within the expressios won't be handled. i.e "-" will be seen as a operator not sign.

Execution: make all
           ./220101050

           Now give the expressions to be evaluated, the calculator can handle multiple calculations
